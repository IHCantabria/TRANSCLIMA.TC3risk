# TRANSCLIMA: Tropical cyclone risk, TC regions

This repository contains scripts and data structures to assess future tropical cyclone under climate change. 

Results of this codes can be found in and are

## üìÇ Folder Structure

### `1_Hazard/return_periods`
- Contains shape files of return periods for each historical and GCMs, which are the base data to calculate TC3hazard and classified administrative regions in TC regions

### `2_Exposure/`
- Includes exposure datasets of coastal population of 2020 + population growth under SSP5 sceenario between 2020 and 2050.

### `3_Adaptive_Capacity/`
- Contains AC indicators.

### `scripts/`
Python scripts for different steps of the workflow:
- **`01_hazard_individual_gcm.py`**: Processes hazard outputs from individual GCMs (Global Climate Models).
- **`02_hazard_ensemble.py`**: Combines hazard information across multiple GCMs into an ensemble product.
- **`03_TC3_risk.py`**: Estimates risk from tropical cyclones (Category 3 and above).
- **`04_statistics.py`**: Runs statistical analyses (uncertainty quantification, correlation, significance testing).
